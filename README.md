### Introduction

The 7-day hackathon organized by GIAIC (Governor’s Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing) was an intensive and rewarding experience, challenging participants to build a fully functional website using Sanity.io as the CMS. Each day introduced a new task, designed to take the project from concept to deployment systematically. This collaborative and hands-on approach not only pushed our technical skills but also highlighted the importance of  planning, and adaptability. Here's a detailed breakdown of the tasks assigned over the six days leading up to the final product.

### Day 1: **Laying the Foundation**
The first day set the stage for the entire hackathon. Teams focused on brainstorming and defining the scope of the website. Key tasks included:  
- Understanding the project requirements and objectives.  
- Conducting research on Sanity.io to explore its potential as a headless CMS.  
- Setting up a project repository and ensuring  every required tools installed.  
- Outlining the website’s basic structure, navigation, and user interface goals.  

By the end of the day, i had a clear vision of the project and i was ready to dive into the technical aspects.

### Day 2: **Establishing the Technical Foundation**
The second day was dedicated to solidifying the project’s technical groundwork. The tasks included:  
- Selecting a frontend framework, such as React, Next.js, or others, to pair with Sanity.  
- Designing the system architecture and determining the workflow for data flow, state management, and API integration.  
- Setting up the project environment, including installing necessary dependencies and scaffolding the file structure.  
- Planning the schema for the CMS to ensure flexibility and scalability.  

This phase ensured i had a robust technical base to build upon.

### Day 3: **API Integration**
On the third day, i began integrating external APIs into our project. Key activities included:  
- Receiving API documentation from the organizers.  
- Testing the API endpoints using tools like Postman to ensure they returned the expected data.  
- Integrating the APIs into our frontend and linking them with the CMS data where required.  
- Ensuring the API calls were efficient and optimized for real-time data retrieval.  

This day marked the transition from theory to practical implementation, as our website began to interact with dynamic content.

### Day 4: **Creating Components**
The fourth day focused on the design and development of the website’s components. Tasks included:  
- Breaking down the user interface into reusable components such as headers, footers, buttons, and cards.  
- Implementing the components with a responsive design approach to ensure compatibility across devices.  
- Connecting the components with the CMS to fetch and display dynamic content seamlessly.  
- Refining the user interface for an optimal user experience.  

This step brought the visual and interactive elements of the website to life.

### Day 5: **Error Handling and Performance Testing**
Day five was dedicated to ensuring the website’s functionality and reliability. focused on:  
- Identifying and resolving any bugs or errors in the code.  
- Testing API responses and handling edge cases to prevent application crashes.  
- Optimizing performance by implementing techniques such as lazy loading, caching, and code splitting.  
- Conducting usability tests to ensure the website met user expectations.
- Created a csv file for all the test cases i performed.

By the end of the day, the website was polished and ready for the next stage.

### Day 6: **Staging and Deployment**
The penultimate day focused on preparing the website for deployment. Tasks included:  
- Setting up a staging environment to simulate the production setup.  
- Deploying the website to a hosting platform such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.  
- Testing the staging environment to ensure all components and APIs functioned as intended.  
- Creating documentation for future maintenance and updates.  

This step ensured that the website was stable, secure, and ready for public access.

### Conclusion
Each day of the hackathon built upon the progress of the previous day, fostering a deep understanding of project management and technical implementation. By the end of the 6th day, i had a fully functional, performance-optimized website ready for launch, showcasing the power of effective planning.

### Day 7: **Business Pitch Deck Creation**
On the final day of the hackathon, I focused on crafting a compelling business pitch deck to present the project. The tasks included:  
- Defining the project’s value proposition and how it solves a specific problem for its target audience.  
- Highlighting the unique features of the website and its technical architecture, including the use of Sanity.io as the CMS.  
- Developing a clear business model, including potential revenue streams and market analysis.  
- Creating slides with visual aids, such as product screenshots, flowcharts, and statistics, to support the pitch.  
- Practicing the pitch to ensure clear communication and a persuasive presentation.  

By the end of the day, I had a polished pitch deck ready to present to potential stakeholders or investors, showcasing the project’s potential beyond its technical aspects.

### Conclusion
The 7-day hackathon was a rewarding experience, blending technical challenges with business strategy. From setting up the project to finalizing the business pitch deck, I learned invaluable lessons in both development and project presentation. The hackathon not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided me with the tools to effectively communicate a product’s value in a competitive market.
